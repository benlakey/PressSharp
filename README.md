PressSharp
==========

A C# class library for parsing Wordpress XML export data.

Ever had a need to deal with exported Wordpress XML data in a .NET project? I have, and since there wasn't a good solution out there already, I decided to create one. The result is PressSharp. It's a simple class library to provide an API to the exported Wordpress XML data. It's also available as a NuGet package:

    Install-Package PressSharp

Check it out!
